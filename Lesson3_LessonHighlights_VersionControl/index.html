            <p class="lead">A Version Control System is a special systematic tool used in software and file management. Version control systems allow developers to be able to save multiple files of their work while in the process of making many updates and changes as they go along. Using a version control system is the most efficient way to stay organized when dealing with up to hundreds of files and a large amount of team members. In order to do this, they collect historical information about who changes the files, when it was done, and what is different. With a version control system, files can’t be overwritten and there is the ability to revert to older versions and backed up files.</p>

            <p class="lead">GIT is a special system for distributed version control of code management and software development. GIT is a free tool that is known to be able to work at high efficiency and speed. Because it is a distributed version control system, it allows for a complete copy of the updating repository data to be distributed and stored of each team member’s local machine. It also prevents the creation of an unintentional overwriting of a file on the shared repository project than many people may be working on at once. GIT is so widely used because it is easy to learn and processes at a fast speed.</p>

            <p class="lead">A repository is a centralized storage place where data from computing programs can be stored and maintained.  A repository can be used as the place that is accessible to the users directly to the network without having to cross other network. It can also contain multiple databases or files are located over a network for distribution. Developers use a repository when there is a large team or there are many files for the same project located on different databases. The repository is the central place where it is necessary to bring together the data files together to be used and progress as one.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A local repository is an aspect and feature of version control systems. They allow for information to be able to be held and stored on a local machine or computer that an individual of a team of developers may be using. There are two different ways for a developer to be able to create a local repository in order to keep their files organized. One way is to create a brand new repository and the other is to clone an existing remote repository onto a local computer. GIT is an example of a version control system that uses local repository method.</p>

            <p class="lead">A remote repository is another aspect and feature of version control systems. They allow for information to be able to be held and stored on a remote server or machine that many members of a team of developers will be able to access individually. They are usually versions of the project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere. A project can use several remote repositories which can be used for read-only or read/write purposes for team workers to be able to manage when collaborating. A remote repository is shared among multiple team members, and information is both push and pulled to and from local repositories. </p>
